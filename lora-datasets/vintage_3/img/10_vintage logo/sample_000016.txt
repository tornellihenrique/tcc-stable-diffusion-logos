This is a black square with a vintage ornate design in the center. Above the design the word "Original" is written in a cursive font in white capital letters. Below the word there is a text that reads "Est 1850 in London. Your text goes here."

There are also also two decorative swirls on either side of the word. These swirls are in a warm brown color creating a luxurious and elegant look.
