the illustration is a cartoon pencil with a red cape and a blue body. It has a happy face with a big smile on its face. Its eyes are closed and its mouth is open as if it is laughing or smiling. It is standing on its hind legs with its arms stretched out to the sides.

Behind the pencil there is a yellow circle with a blue outline. Inside the circle there are two arms and two legs flexing the legs of the pencil.
