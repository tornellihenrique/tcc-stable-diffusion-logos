A cartoon illustration of three green monsters with big round eyes and a red nose. They are arranged in a circle with their arms and legs spread out. Above the monsters there is a yellow square with the word "THE TWINS" written in white capital letters. Below the oval there are two smaller squares with the same word written on them. All three monsters have a happy expression on their faces.
