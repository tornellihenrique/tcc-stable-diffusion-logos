The image is a black and white line drawing of the letter "E" in a square shape. The letter is in the center of the image and is surrounded by two smaller squares on either side. The squares are slightly curved and appear to be made of a thin rectangular material. The background is white making the black lines stand out. The image is simple and minimalistic.
