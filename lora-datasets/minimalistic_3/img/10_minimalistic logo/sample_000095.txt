The image is a black and white line drawing of a mountain range. The mountain range is in the shape of a wave or a line with three peaks on either side. The peaks are slightly curved and appear to be slightly higher than the rest of the mountain range creating a sense of depth and dimension. The background is plain white making the mountain peaks stand out. The image is simple and minimalistic with no additional details or shading.
