The image is a black and white illustration of a circular shape with a curved line on the left side. The line is made up of multiple vertical lines that are arranged in a radial pattern creating a sunburst-like effect. The lines are evenly spaced and appear to be radiating outwards from the center of the circle. The background is white making the black lines stand out. The overall design is simple and minimalistic.
