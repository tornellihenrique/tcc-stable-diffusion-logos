The image is a black and white illustration of a triangular prism. The prism is made up of three triangular shapes each with a pointed tip. The shapes are arranged in a way that they form a triangle shape with the topmost triangle being the largest and the bottom two being the smallest. The triangles are overlapping each other creating a sense of depth and dimension. The image is simple and minimalistic with no additional details or shading.
