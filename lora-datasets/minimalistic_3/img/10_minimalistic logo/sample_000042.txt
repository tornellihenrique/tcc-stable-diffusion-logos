The image is a black and white square with a diamond-shaped design in the center. The diamond is divided into four equal parts each with a small square in the middle. The squares are arranged in a way that they form a cross-like shape with the top half being slightly larger than the bottom half. The background is white making the diamond stand out. The overall design is simple and minimalistic.
