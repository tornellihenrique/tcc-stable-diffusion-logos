The image is a black and white line drawing of a cross. The cross is in the center of the image and is made up of two horizontal lines intersecting each other. The lines are slightly curved and have a slight curve giving the cross a sense of depth and dimension. The word "nun" is written in a cursive font in the same black color as the cross.
