The image is a black and white illustration of a laboratory flask. The flask is in the shape of a triangle with a narrow neck and a wide opening at the top. Inside the triangle there is a geometric design with a diamond-shaped structure in the center. The diamond is made up of lines and dots creating a zigzag pattern. The overall design is simple and minimalistic.
