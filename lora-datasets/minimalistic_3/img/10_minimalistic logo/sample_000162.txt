The image is a circular symbol with a hammer and sickle in the center. The symbol is made up of three curved lines that form a circle with the outermost line being the largest and the innermost line forming the middle. The lines are dark brown in color and appear to be made of a smooth glossy material. The hammer is pointing towards the right side of the circle while the sickle is pointing downwards. The background is white making the symbol stand out.
