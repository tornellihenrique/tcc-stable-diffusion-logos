The image is a black and white line drawing of a windmill. The windmill is in the shape of a square with four blades that are spread out in a fan-like manner. The blades are evenly spaced and appear to be made of metal. The base of the windmill has a small opening at the bottom which is likely used to open and close the blades. The image is simple and minimalistic with no additional details or shading.
