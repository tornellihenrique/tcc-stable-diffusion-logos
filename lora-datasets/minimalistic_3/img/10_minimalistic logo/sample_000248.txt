The image is a black and white line drawing of a shield or a chandelier. The shield is divided into six sections each with a unique design. The top section has a triangular shape with a pointed top and a curved bottom. The middle section has six small circles arranged in a symmetrical pattern. The circles are evenly spaced and appear to be connected by a thin line. The overall design is simple and minimalistic.
