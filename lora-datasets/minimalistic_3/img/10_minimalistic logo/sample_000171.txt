The image is a black and white illustration of the letter "I" in a simple minimalist style. The letter is in the center of the image and is made up of three horizontal bars that are connected by a vertical line. The bars are arranged in a way that they form the shape of a letter "T". The bars appear to be slightly curved and have a smooth texture. The background is plain white.
